// What the dependencies are, rather than whether they are used: known

// published advisory turns it red on an untouched checkout, and that must not
// hide what the house-rule gates have to say about the change itself.
//
// The database is fetched first and on its own, up to three times, and the
// check then runs --frozen: locked and offline. A fetch that keeps failing is
// reported as a gate that could not run, never as an advisory found. A
// deny.toml it cannot read still exits 1, as advisories does; the streamed
